# My Professional Portfolio

## **Description**

- My portfolio is a continuous project that will include featured projects that I have worked on. New versions will include new projects and features. In its current state, users can visit my portfolio and view an about me section, portfolio section, and download my resume. Future versions will include backend handling for the contact form data. 
- This application was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ES6, React, Material UI, bootstrap and deployed on Git Pages
- The motivation behind my portfolio is to showcase my coding experience with a smooth user interface and various projects as examples. 
- While building this site, my intention was to increase my understanding of React, styling React components, and building a single-page application, with martial UI, Bootstrap, and raw JSX.
